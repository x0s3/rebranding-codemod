- [ ] Corner case when removing all components from winery
  - `import "@xingternal/winery-ui";`
- [ ] Support individual imports
  - `import Button from "@xingternal/winery-ui/lib/Button";`
  - Can be fixed running autogroup babel plugin that is already created :)
- [x] ~Support component import aliases~
